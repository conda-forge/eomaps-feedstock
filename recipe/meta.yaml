  summary: A python package to create interactive maps of geographical datasets.

  description: |
    EOmaps is a python package to visualize and analyze geographical datasets.

    It aims to provide a comprehensive, flexible, well-documented and easy-to-use API 
    to create publication-ready maps that can directly be used for interactive data analysis. 

    EOmaps is built on top of matplotlib and cartopy and integrates well with the scientific 
    python infrastructure (e.g., numpy, pandas, geopandas, xarray etc.), allowing you to 
    visualize point-, raster- or vector-datasets provided in almost any format you can imagine, 
    no matter if you're dealing with just a few unsorted datapoints or multi-dimensional stacks 
    of global high-resolution datasets.

    Figures created with EOmaps are multi-layered, so you can (transparently) overlay and 
    interactively compare your datasets with ease. With the accompanying GUI widget, you can 
    quickly switch layers, change the layout, examine the large collection of features and 
    web-map services, and explore the capabilities of EOmaps. Once you're map is ready, you 
    can export it as high-resolution image or vector-graphic for further editing. 
    Leveraging the powers of matplotlib, you can also embed interactive maps in 
    Jupyter Notebooks, on a webpage or in GUI frameworks like Qt, tkinter etc..
