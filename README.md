Summary: A python package to create interactive maps of geographical datasets.

Development: https://github.com/raphaelquast/EOmaps

Documentation: https://eomaps.readthedocs.io/

EOmaps is a python package to visualize and analyze geographical datasets.

It aims to provide a comprehensive, flexible, well-documented and easy-to-use API
to create publication-ready maps that can directly be used for interactive data analysis.

EOmaps is built on top of matplotlib and cartopy and integrates well with the scientific
python infrastructure (e.g., numpy, pandas, geopandas, xarray etc.), allowing you to
visualize point-, raster- or vector-datasets provided in almost any format you can imagine,
no matter if you're dealing with just a few unsorted datapoints or multi-dimensional stacks
of global high-resolution datasets.

Figures created with EOmaps are multi-layered, so you can (transparently) overlay and
interactively compare your datasets with ease. With the accompanying GUI widget, you can
quickly switch layers, change the layout, examine the large collection of features and
web-map services, and explore the capabilities of EOmaps. Once you're map is ready, you
can export it as high-resolution image or vector-graphic for further editing.
Leveraging the powers of matplotlib, you can also embed interactive maps in
Jupyter Notebooks, on a webpage or in GUI frameworks like Qt, tkinter etc..

Installing eomaps
=================

Installing `eomaps` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `eomaps` can be installed with `conda`:

```
conda install eomaps
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba install eomaps
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `eomaps` available on your platform with `conda`:

```
conda search eomaps --channel conda-forge
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba search eomaps --channel conda-forge
```

Alternatively, `mamba repoquery` may provide more information:

```
# Search all versions available on your platform:
mamba repoquery search eomaps --channel conda-forge

# List packages depending on `eomaps`:
mamba repoquery whoneeds eomaps --channel conda-forge

# List dependencies of `eomaps`:
mamba repoquery depends eomaps --channel conda-forge
```


About conda-forge
=================

conda-forge is a community-led conda channel of installable packages.
In order to provide high-quality builds, the process has been automated into the
conda-forge GitHub organization. The conda-forge organization contains one repository
for each of the installable packages. Such a repository is known as a *feedstock*.

A feedstock is made up of a conda recipe (the instructions on what and how to build
the package) and the necessary configurations for automatic building using freely
available continuous integration services. Thanks to the awesome service provided by
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [GitHub](https://github.com/),
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/),
[Drone](https://cloud.drone.io/welcome), and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/)
it is possible to build and upload installable packages to the
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/)
channel for Linux, Windows and OSX respectively.

To manage the continuous integration and simplify feedstock maintenance
[conda-smithy](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy) has been developed.
Using the ``conda-forge.yml`` within this repository, it is possible to re-render all of
this feedstock's supporting files (e.g. the CI configuration files) with ``conda smithy rerender``.

For more information please check the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/).

Terminology
===========

**feedstock** - the conda recipe (raw material), supporting scripts and CI configuration.

**conda-smithy** - the tool which helps orchestrate the feedstock.
                   Its primary use is in the construction of the CI ``.yml`` files
                   and simplify the management of *many* feedstocks.

**conda-forge** - the place where the feedstock and smithy live and work to
                  produce the finished article (built conda distributions)


Updating eomaps-feedstock
=========================

If you would like to improve the eomaps recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`conda-forge` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `conda-forge` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/eomaps-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
